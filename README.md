# Overview of Amazon Vine Analysis

## Background and Purpose
Big Market is a start up company that has the goal of optimizing their marketing efforts. The client $ellBy is asking for a comparison of reviews on their products as well as implementing a new system that gives out free products to select reviewers. $ellBy wants to make sure that this is financially responsible and not a waste of money. Through big data, they would like to see if this new implementation is affordable or not. Through analyzing the amazon public data available, comparing the number of reviews paid for versus not paid for of the amazon_reviews_us_Sports data will help Big Market stratgeize whether the implmentation is afforable or not. 

## Results

    - Thus calculating the percetage of 5 star reviews the result is about 41.61%
 
 - The number of 5 star rating non vine reviews was 32665 out of 61614. 
    - Thus calculating the percentage of 5 star reviews the result is about 53.01%
 
 
 ## Summary
 The positivity bias within in the vine reviews is not significant enough with about a 41% 5 star rating result. The number of 5 star results given by customers who are not apart of the vine program is a higher percentage, as well as a higher feedback rate in general. Big Market implementing this program would not positively influence their company enough through reviews to incurr the costs of giving away free products. 
 
 An additional analysis that could help Big Market optimize their marketing strategies through analyzing the amazon reviews on US sports data is using the lower star ratings and seeing the vine and non vine reviews difference in bad ratings. This process would further the analysis of whether or not adding the vine program is a good idea or not.
